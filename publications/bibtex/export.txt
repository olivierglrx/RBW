abstract={   We study the generation of intensity quantum correlations using four-wave 
mixing in a rubidium vapor. The absence of cavity in these experiments allows 
to deal with several spatial modes simultaneously. In the standard, amplifying, 
configuration, we measure relative intensity squeezing up to 9.2 dB below the 
standard quantum limit. We also theoretically identify and experimentally 
demonstrate an original regime where, despite no overall amplification, quantum 
correlations are generated. In this regime a four-wave mixing set-up can 
therefore play the role of a photonic beam splitter with non--classical 
properties, i.e. a device that splits a coherent state input into two quantum 
correlated beams.

abstract={   We report the generation of a squeezed vacuum state of light whose noise 
ellipse rotates as a function of the detection frequency. The squeezed state is 
generated via a four-wave mixing process in a vapor of 85Rb. We observe that 
rotation varies with experimental parameters such as pump power and laser 
detunings. We use a theoretical model based on the Heisenberg-Langevin 
formalism to describe this effect. Our model can be used to investigate the 
parameter space and to tailor the ellipse rotation in order to obtain an 
optimum squeezing angle, for example, for coupling to an interferometer whose 
optimal noise quadrature varies with frequency.

report a noise reduction of up to $3.8pm 0.2$ dB below the standard quantum

pages={ },
year={2011},
DOI={},
abstract={   We study both theoretically and experimentally the generation of quantum 
correlations in the continuous variable regime by way of four-wave mixing in a 
hot atomic vapor. Two theoretical approaches have been developed. On one side, 
we study the four-wave mixing under the classical non-linear optics point of 
view. In such a way we obtain the evolution equation for an ideal linear 
amplifier in a chi^(3) medium. On the other side, we present a microscopic 
model with 4 levels in the double-Lambda configuration to calculate the 
chi^(3) coefficient in a atomic vapor dressed with a laser. This calculation 
allows us to derive the spectra of intensity noise for interesting parameters. 
The experimental part of this work describes the demonstration of this effect 
on the D1 line of rubidium 85. We present a measurement of relative intensity 
squeezing as high as -9.2dB below the standard quantum limit, and an original 
regime where quantum correlations have been measured without 
amplification.These results have broad applications in the field of multimode 
quantum optics, e.g. quantum imaging or the multimode quantum memories.

abstract={   Motivated by recent experiments, we study four-wave-mixing in an atomic 
double-Lambda system driven by a far-detuned pump. Using the 
Heisenberg-Langevin formalism, and based on the microscopic properties of the 
medium, we calculate the classical and quantum properties of seed and conju- 
gate beams beyond the linear amplifier approximation. A continuous variable 
approach gives us access to relative-intensity noise spectra that can be 
directly compared to experiments. Restricting ourselves to the cold-atom 
regime, we predict the generation of quantum-correlated beams with a 
relative-intensity noise spectrum well below the standard quantum limit (down 
to -6 dB). Moreover entanglement between seed and conjugate beams measured by 
an inseparability down to 0.25 is expected. This work opens the way to the 
generation of entangled beams by four-wave mixing in a cold atomic sample.

abstract={   There is a considerable number of research publications on the acoustical 
properties of porous media with an elastic frame. A simple search through the 
Web of ScienceTM (last accessed 21 March 2018) suggests that there are at least 
819 publications which deal with the acoustics of poroelastic media. A majority 
of these researches require accurate knowledge of the elastic properties over a 
broad frequency range. However, the accuracy of the measurement of the dynamic 
elastic properties of poroelastic media has been a contentious issue. The 
novelty of this paper is that it studies the reproducibility of some popular 
experimental methods which are used routinely to measure the key elastic 
properties such as the dynamic Young's modulus, loss factor and Poisson ratio 
of poroelastic media. In this paper, fourteen independent sets of laboratory 
measurements were performed on specimens of the same porous materials. The 
results from these measurements suggest that the reproducibility of this type 
of experimental method is poor. This work can be helpful to suggest 
improvements which can be developed to harmonize the way the elastic properties 
of poroelastic media are measured worldwide.
